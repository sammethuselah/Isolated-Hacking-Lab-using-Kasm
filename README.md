# Isolated-Hacking-Lab-using-Kasm
This project’s motive is to create an ultimate hacking workspace. This can be an everyday useful thing. It can completely change the game for ethical hackers. As ethical hackers research on hacking stuff almost on a daily basis and there are some sketchy links out there, but with one click a new browser opens, which is isolated, secure and it's not even on their machine. With this even if it’s a malicious link, it doesn't matter. And when the work is done, the session can be deleted without any trace, as if it never existed. This doesn't involve some heavy virtual machines or WSL. It’s Docker containers streaming to your browser.
